This action sets up a go environment for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a version of Go by version and adding to PATH
- registering problem matchers for error output

# V2

The V2 offers:
- Adds GOBIN to the PATH
- Proxy Support
- stable input 
- Bug Fixes (including issues around version matching and semver)

It will first check the local cache for a version match. If version is not found locally, It will pull it from `main` branch of [go-versions](https://github.com/actions/go-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json) repository and on miss or failure, it will fall back to the previous behavior of download directly from [go dist](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang).

Matching by semver spec:
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-go@v2
  with:
    go-version: '^1.13.1' # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use.
- run: go version
```

Matching an unstable pre-release:
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-go@v2
  with:
    stable: 'false'
    go-version: '1.14.0-rc1' # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use.
- run: go version
```

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Basic:
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@master
- uses: actions/setup-go@v1
  with:
    go-version: '1.9.3' # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use.
- run: go run hello.go
```

Matrix Testing:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        go: [ '1.14', '1.13' ]
    name: Go ${{ matrix.go }} sample
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1
        with:
          go-version: ${{ matrix.go }}
      - run: go run hello.go
```
